Set of Functions for REXX (on MVS)

Objective
=========
REXX is one of the easiest languages to learn on the mainframe. It is quick to code, easily interpreted and has ways to connect with just about every other application running on MVS. This code repository is to give small snips of code that will help you with repeated tasks.

All code provided here has been tested. However, I can't guarantee that every possible scenario has been thought out and that there will be NO errors. I am open to your feedback. If you find an issue, you can either report it or fork this repo and fix it and send me a pull request.
